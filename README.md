# Restaurant Billing Automation System....
Requirements Gathering from Restaurant (BRD-Business Requirement Document)
Process-1:
Business Analyst:
After the Business Requirements Document (BRD), the Business Analyst is providing the functional requirements to the Platform Architect.



Process-2:
Platform Architect:
After the Business Analyst provides the functional requirements, the Platform Architect uses them to design the system architecture.
Branch’s (Offline Branch’s)
 UI: The user interface is hosted locally at the branch, allowing users to interact with the system even without internet connectivity.
 MySQL: The local database where all data entries and transactions are stored.
 Status: This branch operates offline, meaning it functions independently without an active internet connection.
 Function: Users input data via the UI, and the data is stored in the local MySQL database.

Data Synchronize Component
 Role: Acts as a middle layer that handles the synchronization of data from offline branches to the central home branch once an internet connection becomes available.
 Mechanism:
o Monitors for internet availability.
o When online, pulls data from the local MySQL.
o Pushes/syncs the data to the Home Branch Server.
 Use Case: Ideal for remote or rural locations where continuous internet is not available.

Home Branch (Central Server)
 Server:
o Hosts the main MySQL database, which acts as the central repository.
o Receives and stores synchronized data from all branches.
 UI: This is the centralized user interface accessible via internet.
Tech Stack: Powered by Python, Django, Node.js, and React, indicating:
o Python/Django for backend APIs and server-side logic.
o Node.js possibly for middleware, services, or real-time functions.
o React for a dynamic and responsive frontend.

Data Syncretization:
Data synchronization is the process of ensuring that data in two or more locations remains consistent, accurate, and up-to-date. It involves the continuous or scheduled alignment of data between systems, devices, or databases, so that any change made in one location is reflected in the others.
Example: If a user updates their contact information on a mobile app, data synchronization ensures that the same update appears on the web application and the backend database.



Process-3:
After discussing the architecture, the manager will consult with team members and assign separate tasks to each team member.
Engineer team:
